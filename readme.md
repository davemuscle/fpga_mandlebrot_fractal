*Migrated to Git on February 20th, 2022. Original release November 13th, 2020.*

A fractal is a recursive geometric pattern: think of a triangle inside of a triangle inside of a
triangle. If you're familiar with fractals, you've probably already seen the Mandlebrot fractal.
It's a fractal that is described purely by a simple math equation. Images like the one shown below
can be easily generated by just adding, multiplying, and comparing complex numbers.

Implementing the Mandlebrot fractal can be a good project for experimenting with any technical
platform. I decided that writing a Mandlebrot fractal generator purely on an FPGA sounded fun: it
could give the opportunity to fully utilize the hardware and optimize for the highest frequency
possible. But what started as a goal to learn pipelining, timing analysis techniques, and HDMI
interfaces turned into a stubborn nightmare of fighting with a cheap FPGA. This project took place
mainly between July and August of 2020.

## Implementation

### The Mandlebrot Fractal

The Mandlebrot set is described by a single math equation:
